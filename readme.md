BIG BOY RADIO
====

A nostalgic Node.js radio station.

No next, no previous, no pause, no play, no volume.  On/off.

It reads your iTunes library, worships "sort by Date Added", picks a random era to play from, and plays the result. 

Designed to be run from a remote computer (read: Raspberry Pi) but eventually moving to a local solution/cocoa app?
